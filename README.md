# OTP-Based Authentication System

This Spring Boot application implements an OTP-based authentication system. Users log in with their credentials, and an OTP is sent to their email for verification. The system ensures secure access by combining username/password authentication with OTP verification. Key features include user authentication, OTP generation and validation, email integration, and database storage using Spring Data JPA. The project uses Spring Boot, Spring Mail, MySQL, and Maven. Future enhancements include password encryption, JWT authentication, and role-based access control.
